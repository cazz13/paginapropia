                The Federales found a room full of bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.  Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.  Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win.  Okay, so, uhh... We just wait around for this Quill guy to show up and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?   I think you look great, Cap. As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass.  Let me tell you. That kid's not even here yet, and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him. Good to meet you, Potts. You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist. 

I did. For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds...  We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?  Noobmaster? Yeah, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy. If you don't log off this game immediately, I'm gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms then shove them up your butt! Oh, that's right. Yes, now go cry to your father, you little weasel!

Because once we are done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken. So, chronologically, in that reality, it never left.  Oh, my eye. That's... you remember the Battle of Haroquin? When I got hit in the face with a broadsword? 

            Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too.  These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We're not making any more.  It's time for me to be who I am rather than who I'm supposed to be. But you, you're a leader. That's who you are.

Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team.  I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true. Think about it: If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can't now be changed by your new future...  The coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out.  No. The same Nebula. From two different times. Set course for Morag. Scan the duplicate's memories. I want to see everything. </p>
